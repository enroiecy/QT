			<h3>Deuteronomy 16:13-22</h3>
			<small>Posted by Eric Yeon on May 11th, 2020</small>
			<p>
				<strong>Key Verse:</strong> 17
				<br><br>
				<strong>Message:</strong> In today's passage, the Lord requires the Israelites to celebrate the Feast of Unleavened Bread, Feast of Weeks, and the Feast of Tabernacles in remembrance of Him. In verse 16 and 17, God tells them they must come before Him with gifts in proportion to how they were blessed and must come empty-handed. It seems so demanding of the Lord to ask them to sacrifice a bunch of their possessions before Him, but I must remember that God doesn't need anything from me. He is all-powerful and all-knowing. He just wants my heart. I am given free will to do as I please and with such power, I should give Him my all out of the willingness of my heart. It shouldn't be because of what He has done for me, but because I understand who I am to Him. However, once again, I was able to reflect on my lack of trust and my attitude towards God. He is perfect, He is good, He is powerful, He is just, so why should and how could I live my life in such doubt? God empowers me to do what He has commanded of me. I experience greater energy for His work as I conform myself to His character and ways. Thus, I must allow Him to examine my heart so that He might remove any resistance to His will.
				<br><br>
				<strong>Application:</strong> Stop worrying about the future that is far ahead of me for that is in God's hand. I should live in the moment and instead give God my full attention. This is vague, but I need to stop worrying about things that are essentially out of my control and not of upmost relevance. So, I should be thankful for the present moment and what I have now.
				<br><br>
				<strong>Prayer to God:</strong> Lord, thank you for saving me. For how great you are, you don't require anything of us except our obedience and worship to You. You have given us the choice to live our lives the way we choose and I pray that everyone on this Earth will be able to realize your goodness and live accordingly. I don't want to abuse your grace God, but I need it every day. It's the only thing that ever really makes me change. Give me the wisdom to take each day step by step and the strength to overcome any difficulties that may come in my way. Thank you. In Jesus's name, Amen!

			<h3>Deuteronomy 16:1-12</h3>
			<small>Posted by Eric Yeon on May 10th, 2020</small>
			<p>
				<strong>Key Verse:</strong> 12
				<br><br>
				<strong>Message:</strong> In today's quiet time, God demands obedience from the Israelites through the celebration of the Passover of the Lord as well as the Feast of Weeks. In verse 12, God emphasizes to His people to never forget that they were once slaves in Egypt. I must never forget that I have been saved from an eternity in hell. Romans 6:23 tells us that the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus. Something along those lines, but I was reminded that I mustn't take this life for granted. I was supposed to die. I was supposed to have no purpose. Death was supposed to be the endgame, but God gave me victory over death. I am no longer a slave to this fear, but now am a child of God. He delivered me, He has chosen me, He has called me by name, and I have been born again. The precious blood of Jesus redeems and I am forgiven. Therefore, I will forever believe in Him and his truth and righteousness. I know his love will never fail and it is an absolute honor to be able to know His name. He gives me identity and tells me who I am on this earth. I must remind myself that this earth is temporary and fleeting, but God is eternal. This journey of life is difficult and I haven't even gone through I'd say half my life yet. Conformity is and I believe will be the hardest for me, but I must must must always remember that this life is not mine, but His. I need to be led by His word, not by this world. I must surrender all things that are getting in the way of my complete and upmost praise to God. It is so easy to just live my life and forget about the ultimate gift He has given me.
				<br><br>
				<strong>Application:</strong> Obviously, it's hard for me to just completely turn my life around. So, I believe the first step is for me to just live with good morals and live righteously. People should see me and not be surprised that I believe in Jesus. However, this isn't the case and even when I look at my lifestyle, I don't see a very godly, per say, way of life. Also, to pray constantly. Whether I am just walking around, driving, or chilling, I should always lift up quick prayers to God. Be in constant communication with Him.
				<br><br>
				<strong>Prayer to God:</strong> Lord, my life is Yours. You have saved me from an eternity in hell and I have yet to show you how thankful I am. I have become very complacement with where I am right now, but this must change. Give me strength to overcome this world and its ways. May You guide me and give me the wisdom to know and understand. May you give me the strength to overcome difficulties and hardships. Give me the energy to always be joyful and enthusiastic for there is nothing in this world that I need except You. Thank you for always being the same God since the beginning. I love you. In Jesus's name, Amen!

			<h3>Deuteronomy 15:1-11</h3>
			<small>Posted by Eric Yeon on May 8th, 2020</small>
			<p>
				<strong>Key Verse:</strong> 9
				<br><br>
				<strong>Message:</strong> In today's passage, the Lord instructs the Israelites to cancel the debt of every fellow Israelite every seven years. He requires that no one be poor, but be provided for by those around him or her. In verse 9, it says not to harbor this wicked thought: "The seventh year, the year for canceling debts, is near..." The Lord mentions this because He does not want anybody to show ill will toward others and give them nothing. In fact, He says this is an act of disobedience and those people are found guilty of sin. This shows that God cares about the intent of our hearts. Sometimes, I may show others encouragement and support with an ungrateful and unloving heart. I think this verse emphasizes that harboring such deceit is wicked and evil. In verse 10, God reassures the Israelites that they will be blessed if they give generously to others and without a grudging heart. This is such a straightforward message that I believe applies even to this day. When Jesus came to this Earth, all he did was serve others even though He was the king of kings, a perfect man, and the son of God. If Jesus could be so humble when seeing all the wicked evil around Him that displeased God, why is it so hard for me to have a humble heart of servitude? I was just reminded once again that I am called to this earth to serve others and this should be done out of the willingness of my heart. It should not matter that others see the good that I do. If that is the case even in the slightest, then I am doing it all wrong. God is watching and He just asks for my obedience. I am no better than others and material possessions don't define us. We are all the children of God. 
				<br><br>
				<strong>Application:</strong> Constantly remind myself of how Jesus stooped down to us and served us. I must be like Jesus and serve others with a open heart. Throughout the day, try to help out my family with little things and do it with a heart of servitude.
				<br><br>
				<strong>Prayer to God:</strong> Lord, thank you for allowing us to take refuge in You. When we feel like there is no one else, You are always there for us. In times of difficulty and distress, You always have Your arms wide open for us. I ask for a heart of servitude. Just as you commanded the Israelites to help other fellow Israelites out of the goodness of their hearts, I ask for the same heart. Help me for it is hard for me to serve others without expecting anything in return. I ask that you remove this selfish desire from me and help me to grow into a humble servant of You.

			<h3>Deuteronomy 14:22-29</h3>
			<small>Posted by Eric Yeon on May 7th, 2020</small>
			<p>
				<strong>Key Verse:</strong> 29
				<br><br>
				<strong>Message:</strong> In today's passage, the Lord commands the Israelites to worship him in a certain place with tithes and offerings. Moreover, they are also instructed to provide for the Levites every three years since they had little possession of their own. I was reminded once again that the Lord cares for ALL His people. The Levites were not God's chosen people, yet He saw that they lived amongst the Israelites. Thus, He wanted to provide for and care for them as well. The Israelites probably dissociated themselves from them since they were not of the same tribe. Even when the Israelites returned from the captivity of the Babylons, they stayed away from the other Israelites who had not been captured to Babylon, but had married gentiles while they were living in Jerusalem. The reasoning behind this was because they were not pure, but if you think about it, they all lived peacefully together at one point and it's unfair to think that they should be treated differently just because they were, in a sense, lucky enough to stay behind. This just reminds me that the Lord is always looking for a unified body in Christ. After the sacrifice of Jesus, we are all God's people. Continuing from yesterday's qt, this statement that we are all the same in God's eyes has been tugging at me. Throughout my life and even to this day, I have been such a judgmental person who stayed away from those who I thought were weird or strange. But, God loves us all and I don't know how many times He has to remind me whether through the word, my pastors, or just other people in general. Since I have been fortunate enough to know God and understand what He has done for me, there really shouldn't be other things in this life that motivate me. In other words, I should not be looking for acceptance from other people, I should take other peoples' rebukes in a healthy way, and I should really just spread His light to others.
				<br><br>
				<strong>Application:</strong> Be happy. Be thankful because I have been blessed with growing up hearing His word and knowing the truth. Practically, I want to watch what I say since I don't know how it can affect others even if I don't have any bad intent. In fact, I need to stop cussing because even though I say that it's a way for me to express myself, there are so many other words for me to choose. Why choose the words that this world and society views as unfitting and improper? This can just lead others away. Rather, I should stay away from disgusting words that others may view more vulgar than I do. So, I want to try to work on that.
				<br><br>
				<strong>Prayer to God:</strong> Lord, thank you for this day. May your name be lifted high and be exalted forever. I ask for your guidance during this time because I believe you are calling me back to you. I have strayed far from you the past few years for I have been chasing the wrong things in this life. You are the way and the truth, so I ask that you continue to lead me along the right path. Thank you for always being such a great God. In Jesus's name, Amen!

			<h3>Deuteronomy 14:1-21</h3>
			<small>Posted by Eric Yeon on May 6th, 2020</small>
			<p>
				<strong>Key Verse:</strong> 2
				<br><br>
				<strong>Message:</strong> In today's passage, it goes over a set of rules from the Law of the Book of Moses. The Israelites are told not to eat certain animals and refrain themselves from certain activities for the Lord has "chosen them to be His treasured possession." As His people, they are called to higher standards for they represent the Lord through their lives. I thought about this now and it made me think about how every one on this Earth is now God's people. After the sacrifice of Jesus, we are all called to be in relationship with Him. The Israelites back then had to keep each other accountable in following the Laws. Since we are all His people, I am held accountable for being a living testimony and witness to the truth that I have been blessed with knowing. My actions and words can unknowingly stray others away from God. I was just reminded that I must be a good influence for others and be a little Jesus. 
				<br><br>
				<strong>Application:</strong> Simply be kind to others. There is no reason for me to be an ass. Be less judgmental of others, but instead I should be supportive of them. Also, to watch my language for I don't know who I can offend.
				<br><br>
				<strong>Prayer to God:</strong> Lord, you are good as always. I ask to be able to see and understand things through your perspective. I want to grieve when you grieve and to delight in things you delight in. Help me to really strive after your heart and to be a light for others. Use me as a part of your plan and give me the heart of servitude always. Thank you for everything you have done for us. In Jesus's name, Amen!

			<h3>Deuteronomy 13:12-18</h3>
			<small>Posted by Eric Yeon on May 5th, 2020</small>
			<p>
				<strong>Key Verse:</strong> 17
				<br><br>
				<strong>Message:</strong> In continuation with yesterday's passage, God instructs the Israelites to put to death any city that has turned from God. It may seem as though God is being unfair here and not giving His people a chance; however, God has given them many chances to turn back to Him. Thus, He wants the destruction of such towns and everything found to be sacrificed to Him. It is evident that God does not tolerate such behavior and He even goes as far to say that those towns are never to be rebuilt, but remain ruins forever. In verse 17, God says that if His people are obedient to Him, he will turn from his anger, but show mercy and compassion. All He desires is my obedience, but I fail to do so every day. I feel like understanding God's persepctive here just makes His son's sacrifice mean so much more. Even though God feels this way when we turn against Him, He still sacrificed his perfect son to give all of us, sinners, a chance to build a relationship with him even through our sinful lives. How precious is the blood that makes me whole again, yet I still live a life of sin. Today's passage made me evaluate my life and why I live my life in such a way. I have found the truth and have been blessed with knowing God since I was born, but why do I struggle so much? Innately, I am a sinner and I understand that, but since I know the truth, why is it so hard for me to turn my life around? I need to reevaluate what I really value in this life. I say that I want it to be of Jesus, but I live a life of hypocrisy and denial. I take the temporary joys in this life over the indescribable joy that God is able to give me.
				<br><br>
				<strong>Application:</strong> Throughout the day, just take notice of the blessings God has poured down into my life. Also, to pray for a heart that really yearns for him and to reignite that passion for Him once again. I feel like doing my QT every day and reading his word is a good start to this. Then, I am able to understand Him better and see that He really is all that matters in this life.
				<br><br>
				<strong>Prayer to God:</strong> Start a fire in my soul. Fan the flame and make it grow Lord, so there's no doubt or denying. Let it burn so brightly that everyone around can see that it's You that we need. I lack the passion and a lot of your truth has become numb to me. Reignite that passion Lord. Thank you for I know you are good. In Jesus's name, Amen!

			<h3>Deuteronomy 13:1-11</h3>
			<small>Posted by Eric Yeon on May 4th, 2020</small>
			<p>
				<strong>Key Verse:</strong> 6
				<br><br>
				<strong>Message:</strong> In today's text, the Israelites are being warned by God to not fall into temptation of worshipping other gods. All throughout the deuteronomistic history, the Israelites have been punished for this repeating sin. Yet, they constantly fall into the same trap. Here, they are being warned and it seems as though many of the Israelites have already turned away from Him. Verse 6 stuck out to me since God is warning us that a close friend or family member can be the one tempting us to fall into the sin of idolatry. However, after reflecting upon it, it makes sense since even the very first sin was caused through Satan tempting Adam through Eve. Today's passage was just a strong reminder to hold firm in my faith when those around me may cause me to place other things in my life before God. More so, I realized I should be more focused on myself and how I can be such an influence to the people around me. Whether I am oblivious or not to causing that person to sin, I am still the cause of such transgressions. As the text progresses, God states that those who cause others to turn away from Him should be put to death and should not be shown any mercy or pity. I know God won't kill or inflict harm upon me now, but it just shows God's attitude towards such practices. Thus, when I place other activities or things higher on my list than God, I can only imagine how hurt and angry he feels. The God who has done so much for me and cared for me, yet I still place him underneath my friends, games, and even my studies. 
				<br><br>
				<strong>Application:</strong> On top of doing my qt as well as reading my proverb and psalms, to spend at least thirty minutes in prayer every morning and night.
				<br><br>
				<strong>Prayer to God:</strong> Dear Heavenly Father, I ask for your forgiveness for my sins. Through today's text, I was able to understand your heart more and how you feel when I prioritize other things when it should be You at the throne of my life. I ask for your wisdom, so that I may not lead other down the wrong path. I know I am a sinner and I am broken, but use me to spread your glory and light to those in my life. Thank you for being the God you are and I love you. In Jesus' name, Amen!

			<h3>Deuteronomy 2:26-37</h3>
			<small>Posted by Eric Yeon on March 28th, 2020</small>
			<p>
				<strong>Key Verse:</strong> 31
				<br><br>
				<strong>Message:</strong> In today's passage, the Israelites are finally given the command to conquer the land of Heshbon. After multiple chapters of God telling them not to instigate anything against the surrounding nations, He allows them to possess Sihon's land. The baffling part was verse 30 where it says, "For the LORD your God had made [Sihon's] spirit stubborn and his heart obstinate in order to give him into [the Israelite's] hands, as he has now done." God purposely hardened King Sihon's heart in order for His plan to come into fruition. I must not forget that the Israelites were God's chosen people and it was God's intention for them to take over Sihon's land. I was reminded that God is omnipotent and there is a reason for everything He does. When God makes a promise to us, He always delivers. Sometimes it may be the way we might think it will happen, but many times, He carries out His will in His own way. I was reminded that I must be patient with God. Moreover, I must understand and accept that not everything is going to go my way. God is in control at all times and I must fully trust Him. I was able to reflect on my lack of trust and my attitude towards God. He is perfect, he is good, he is powerful, he is just, so why should and how could I ever doubt Him? God empowers me to do what He has commanded of me. I experience greater energy for His work as I conform myself to His character and ways. Thus, I must allow Him to examine my heart so that He might remove any resistance to His will.
				<br><br>
				<strong>Application:</strong> When things aren't going my way, understand that God is allowing it to happen like this for a reason. Instead of reacting with anger and distrust, pray to God for a heart of servitude and joy.
				<br><br>
				<strong>Prayer to God:</strong> Heavenly Father, thank you that You always go before me when I face spiritual opposition. Help me to draw my strength from Your Word and Holy Spirit. Be glorified in my life and actions today. In Jesus' name, Amen!

			<h3>Detueronomy 2:16-25</h3>
			<small>Posted by Eric Yeon on March 27th, 2020</small>
			<p>
				<strong>Key Verse:</strong> 25
				<br><br>
				<strong>Message:</strong> In today's passage, God continues to warn the Israelites from provoking the surrounding lands to war. This may seem odd since the Israelites were the "chosen people," yet God is telling them to move on. In verse 25, God finally commands them to take possession of King Sihon's land (Heshbon) advising them of the terror other nations will soon have of the Israelites. After reading this, I'm assuming that although these events are happening within 10 verses, it probably spanned over multiple months and maybe even years. He does everything in His timing and all that He does is for a purpose. The Israelites were probably a little frustrated with God because they finally left Egypt, but were still wandering around like nomads. When God makes a promise to us, He always delivers. Sometimes it may be the way we might think it will happen, but many times, He carries out His will in His own way. I was reminded that I must be patient with God. Moreover, I must understand and accept that not everything is going to go my way. God is in control at all times and I must fully trust Him. I was able to reflect on my lack of trust and my attitude towards God. He is perfect, he is good, he is powerful, he is just, so why should and how could I ever doubt Him? God empowers me to do what He has commanded of me. I experience greater energy for His work as I conform myself to His character and ways. Thus, I must allow Him to examine my heart so that He might remove any resistance to His will.
				<br><br>
				<strong>Application:</strong> Stop worrying about the future that is far ahead of me for that is in God's hand. Worrying does nothing, but instead, I should live in the moment and ask God for guidance with every step I take. This is pretty vague, but seriously, I should stop worrying about things that are essentially not of upmost relevance and out of my control.
				<br><br>
				<strong>Prayer to God:</strong> Lord, thank you for being You. Help me to remain humble and obedient as Your spirit leads me daily. Just as you have gave the Israelites comfort and strength, I pray that I may rely on you for the same as well. Thank you for giving us victory and we love you. In Jesus' name, Amen!

			<h3>Deuteronomy 1:34-46</h3>
			<small>Posted by Eric Yeon on March 25th, 2020</small>
			<p>
				<strong>Key verse:</strong> 43
				<br><br>
				<strong>Message:</strong> In today's passage, it shows God's chosen people rebelling against his command to not fight. As expected, they are defeated by the Amorites due to their hasty decision to fight. Although God is on our side, if my heart is not aligned with His, my decisions and actions are not glorifying Him even if I think they are. The Israelites may have thought they had the support of God, but their ears and minds were not open to receiving His voice. Back then, they had prophets and leaders who explicitly received instructions and from the Lord. However, times have changed; the word of God is how God communicates with us as well as through prayer. I must continually indulge myself in the word of God to truly understand his heart so that I may live out my life that is pleasing to the Lord. What I think is right doesn't suffice. That is why I must pray to truly understand God's heart and see things in His perspective. With God, anything is possible and every obstacle is just a hurdle to strenghthen my faith.
				<br><br>
				<strong>Application:</strong> Read my daily Proverbs for this week. Before making any major decisions, consult God first. Pray to him for the answer and ask for His Holy Spirit to guide and lead me.
				<br><br>
				<strong>Prayer to God:</strong> Jesus, soften my heart today. Your gospel feels numb. I ask for a heart that yearns for you every second of my life. Living like this is hard, but to me, it is joyful. Help me to hear Your voice and Your voice only. Give me the wisdom to understand and have discernment within all situations of my life. Living your truth out will give me the greatest joy anyone can experience. However, all of that knowledge is in my head and not my heart, so please break me down. I want to live out Your truth out of the willingness of my heart for You have given me and all of us the greatest gift of all. In Jesus's name, Amen!
